This self-assessment page completes the Amorphous Materials module, and covers material from the following sessions.

*   Session 21: [Introduction to Glasses]({{< baseurl >}}/pages/amorphous-materials/21-introduction-to-glasses)
*   Session 22: [Engineering Glass Properties]({{< baseurl >}}/pages/amorphous-materials/22.-engineering-glass-properties-introduction-to-kinetics) (first part)

The second part of [Session 22: Introduction to Kinetics]({{< baseurl >}}/pages/amorphous-materials/22.-engineering-glass-properties-introduction-to-kinetics) will be included in the [Self-Assessment]({{< baseurl >}}/pages/reactions-and-kinetics/self-assessment-reactions-and-kinetics) for the next module, Reactions & Kinetics.

On this page are a simple **weekly quiz and solutions**; relevant **exam problems and solutions** from the 2009 class; **help session videos** that review selected solutions to the exam problems; and **supplemental exam problems and solutions** for further study.

Weekly Quiz and Solutions
