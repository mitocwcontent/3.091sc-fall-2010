### Prerequisites

Before starting this session, you should be familiar with:

*   The Bonding and Molecules module ([Session 7]({{< baseurl >}}/pages/structure-of-the-atom/7.-the-aufbau-principle-photoelectron-spectroscopy) through [Session 12]({{< baseurl >}}/pages/bonding-and-molecules/12.-intermolecular-forces))
*   Chemistry of glasses (Amorphous Materials module), in [Session 21]({{< baseurl >}}/pages/amorphous-materials/21-introduction-to-glasses) and [Session 22]({{< baseurl >}}/pages/amorphous-materials/22.-engineering-glass-properties-introduction-to-kinetics)

### Learning Objectives

After completing this session, you should be able to:

*   Define what makes an "aqueous solution."
*   Explain the behavior of **ionic compounds** in **water.**
*   Calculate **molarity** of a solution.
*   Predict the **solubility** of different combinations of **solutes** and **solvents**, given the chemical properties of those compounds.
*   Explain the dynamics of solutions using the concepts of **equilibrium constant**, **solubility product**, and **common ion effect.**

### Lecture Summary

This session surveys the chemistry of aqueous solutions, in which **ionic compounds** are dissolved in liquid water as a **solvent**. The rule "_like dissolves like_" means that a **solute** tends to dissolve best in a solvent with similar chemical structure. **Molarity** is defined as a measure of **solubility**, and conventions for classifying substances as **soluble** and **insoluble** are presented. The session also defines and examines the importance of **equilibrium constant K** and **solubility product Ksp**, and the **common ion effect**.

The class ends with a discussion of the properties of **amorphous glasses**, including recent advances in fabrication and product manufacturing using bulk metallic glasses.
