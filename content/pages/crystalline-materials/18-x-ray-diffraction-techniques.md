| **Keywords** | x-ray diffraction, Braggs’ law, angle of incidence, angle of reflection, constructive interference, destructive interference, crest, trough, amplitude, wavelength, phase, monochromatic, coherent light, incoherent light, order of reflection, index of refraction, collimator, diffraction peak, rotational symmetry, Laue diffraction, quasicrystal, translational symmetry, long-range order, x-ray crystallography, Penrose tiles, William Henry Bragg, William Lawrence Bragg, Max von Laue, Roger Penrose, Peter Debye, Peter Scherrer, Dan Shechtman |

| **Applications** | growth of single-crystal Si, identification of planes and symmetry in crystals, Penrose tiles 

### Prerequisites

Before starting this session, you should be familiar with the prior topics in this module ([Session 15]({{< baseurl >}}/pages/crystalline-materials/15-introduction-to-crystallography) through [Session 17]({{< baseurl >}}/pages/crystalline-materials/17-x-ray-emission-absorption)), especially:

*   Miller indices for crystal directions and planes
*   SC, FCC, and BCC crystal structures
*   X-ray production methods and characteristic emission lines (Cu Kα, etc.)

### Looking Ahead

X-ray diffraction is a popular technique to discover the structures of organic molecules such as proteins ([Session 31]({{< baseurl >}}/pages/organic-materials/31-protein-structure)) and, most famously, DNA ([Session 32]({{< baseurl >}}/pages/organic-materials/32-lipids-nucleic-acids-dna)), as well as inorganic crystals. It is also used to determine the degree of long-range order and symmetry present in a crystal, or lacking in a glass, which is the topic of the next module ([Session 21: Introduction to Glasses]({{< baseurl >}}/pages/amorphous-materials/21-introduction-to-glasses)).

### Learning Objectives

After completing this session, you should be able to:

*   Sketch the reflection of incident radiation off **atomic planes**, and derive **Braggs' law** for this geometry.
*   Identify which planes produce x-ray **diffraction peaks** in FCC and BCC crystals.
*   Given a graph of x-ray intensity vs. angle, or the 2θ values of the diffraction peaks, determine the **crystal structure** and **lattice constant** of the sample.
*   Explain the difference between **x-ray diffractometry** and **Laue diffraction**.
*   Determine the types of **symmetry** present in a given tiling pattern.

### Lecture Summary

X-rays reflect off each atomic plane in a crystal, producing patterns of **destructive** and **constructive interference** according to **Braggs' law**. One popular method of determining crystal structure, **x-ray diffractometry**, involves monochromatic x-rays bouncing off a rotating target; the resulting **peaks** indicate the identity and spacing of the **close-packed planes**, which are different for FCC and BCC. Another method, **Laue diffraction**, uses x-rays of multiple wavelengths and a fixed target, producing a pattern reflective of the **symmetry** present in the crystal structure. The cubic lattices include planes that have **1, 2, 3, or 4-fold** rotational symmetry, but **quasicrystals** displaying **5-fold** structures have been observed in experiments on Al-Mn alloys and generated mathematically as Penrose tiles.
