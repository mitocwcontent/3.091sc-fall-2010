### Prerequisites

Before starting this session, you should be familiar with:

*   Ionic crystal lattices ([Session 8](/courses/materials-science-and-engineering/3-091sc-introduction-to-solid-state-chemistry-fall-2010/bonding-and-molecules/8.-ionic-crystals-born-haber-cycle))
*   Cubic crystal structures ([Session 15]({{< baseurl >}}/pages/crystalline-materials/15-introduction-to-crystallography))
*   Distribution of energies as described by Maxwell-Boltzmann statistics ([Session 14]({{< baseurl >}}/pages/electronic-materials/14-semiconductors))

### Looking Ahead

Compare the expression for the energy required to produce a vacancy, derived in this lecture, with the expression for the rate of a chemical reaction (the Arrhenius equation), presented in [Session 22: Introduction to Kinetics](/courses/materials-science-and-engineering/3-091sc-introduction-to-solid-state-chemistry-fall-2010/amorphous-materials/22.-engineering-glass-properties-introduction-to-kinetics).

### Learning Objectives

After completing this session, you should be able to:

*   Sketch a crystal containing any of the following defects: **substitutional impurity**, **interstitial impurity**, **vacancy**, **Schottky**, **Frenkel**.
*   Calculate the **vacancy concentration** in a crystal at a given temperature.
*   Write expressions for defects in a given ionic crystal, and explain why they have higher **energies of formation** than similar defects in metallic crystals.
*   Explain why a given crystal has either **substitutional** or **interstitial impurity atoms**.
*   Give 3 examples of additives that have a detrimental effect on the surrounding crystal, and 3 examples that improve the material properties.

### Lecture Summary

Prof. Michael Demkowicz ([homepage](https://engineering.tamu.edu/materials/people/demkowicz-michael-j.html)) lectures today, introducing the next topic: imperfections in crystal lattices. In the real world, materials rarely consist of single, perfect crystals; **defects** in crystals occur naturally, or are introduced during processing. While unwanted defects can **weaken** or **contaminate** materials (e.g. Li+ in saline solution (NaCl(aq)), others can create enhanced properties (e.g. **alloys**, **dopants**). Creating an empty crystal lattice site (**vacancy**) requires overcoming bonds with nearest-neighbor atoms, typically with **thermal energy**. Vacancies in a regular lattice of A atoms may be filled by an atom of B (**substitutional**, e.g. P in Si, B in C), while **interstitial** sites can host atoms of A (self interstitial) or B (interstitial impurity, e.g. C in Fe, H in LaNi5, H in Fe). In ionic crystals, overall **charge neutrality** must be preserved, so a whole stoichiometric unit may be removed to create two or more vacancies (**Schottky**); one ion may move to an interstitial site (**Frenkel**); or one or more electrons may fill an anionic vacancy (**F-center**). Line defects occur when a **lattice mismatch** runs through the crystal.
