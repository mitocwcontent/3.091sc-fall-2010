### Prerequisites

This session assumes you've completed the Bonding and Molecules module ([Session 7]({{< baseurl >}}/pages/structure-of-the-atom/7.-the-aufbau-principle-photoelectron-spectroscopy) through [Session 12]({{< baseurl >}}/pages/bonding-and-molecules/12.-intermolecular-forces)), in particular understanding the concepts of

*   hybridization (spx orbitals)
*   different types of bonds (pi bond, double bond, triple bond, resonance)
*   dipole moments

### Looking Ahead

This session is the first of six sessions on organic compounds. The next two sessions cover polymers, followed by three sessions applying these concepts to biochemistry.

### Learning Objectives

After completing this session, you should be able to:

*   Define what constitutes an **organic compound**.
*   Apply the **naming and drawing conventions** to describe different organic compounds.
*   Compare and contrast the three types of **hydrocarbons** \- **alkanes**, **alkenes**, and **alkynes**.
*   Describe the range of **molecular structures (e.g. straight vs. branched chains)** found among organic compounds.
*   Describe the physical structure of chemical **isomers**.

### Lecture Summary

This lecture is a single-session introduction to organic chemistry: the chemistry of **hydrocarbon** compounds containing both carbon (C) and hydrogen (H), plus other elements. The class begins with a review of what makes carbon special: uniquely capable of forming multiple bonds, capable of self-linking, etc. Most of the session is a survey of three types of hydrocarbons: **alkanes**, **alkenes**, and **alkynes**. A hydrocarbon's properties are determined by characteristics like the type of chain (**straight chains** vs. **branched chains**), bond types (**pi, double, and triple bonds**), and **resonance**.

Naming and nomenclature conventions receive much attention. Woven throughout the lecture are discussions about:

*   name **prefixes** (e.g. meth-, eth-) and **suffixes** (e.g. -ane, -ene)
*   **drawing conventions** for different **bond types**
*   **IUPAC** (International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry) nomenclature
*   ways to represent different **isomers**

Among the applications used for illustration, the lecture describes why acetylene is so energetic as a fuel, why graphite is a good electrical conductor, and the chemical basis of gasoline octane ratings.

Homework
--------

No homework is assigned for this session.

For Further Study
-----------------

As a single-session overview of organic chemistry, this class has limited scope. For instance, it does not introduce every class of organic compounds, leaving aldehydes, ketones, and esters for further study.
