### Prerequisites

Before starting this session, you should be familiar with:

*   [Session 27: Organic Chemistry]({{< baseurl >}}/pages/organic-materials/27-introduction-to-organic-chemistry)

### Looking Ahead

This session is the first of two devoted to polymers. The polymers sessions are prerequisites for Sessions 30-32 on biochemistry.

### Learning Objectives

After completing this session, you should be able to:

*   Define key terms used in polymer chemistry.
*   Describe a polymer's structure in terms of **–mer type ordering**, **tacticity**, and **backbone chain configuration**.
*   Explain how polymer structure determines **material properties**, such as flexibility or transparency.
*   Explain how **crosslinking** produces the characteristic properties of an **elastomer**.
*   Appreciate the role of polymers in both **natural and synthetic materials**.

### Lecture Summary

Polymer chemistry is an example of applied organic chemistry. Polymers are long chain **macromolecules** built from repeated smaller chemical structures or '**\-mers**.' They are found widely in the **natural** world (e.g. proteins, rubber, cellulose) and, increasingly the past century, in **synthetic** form (e.g. "plastics"). Polymers have been central to many technological innovations that shape the modern world, such as film that enabled the cinema, or the progression of vinyl LPs to polycarbonate CDs and DVDs that enabled recorded music and video distribution.

This lecture begins by describing some basic characteristics of polymers. A polymer's physical properties are influenced by the **degree of ordering** in the molecular chains. A comparison of low-density and high-density polyethylene (LDPE and HDPE) reveals that HDPE is molecularly more ordered, with more **zones of partial crystallization**, and thus more dense and rigid than LDPE. As a result, LDPE is quite flexible and transparent, suited for food wrap; whereas HDPE is optically translucent and more rigid, suited for a milk jug.

The lecture describes polymer molecular architecture in terms of:

*   Comparing pure (**homopolymer**) vs. mixed or "alloy" compositions (**copolymer**)
*   Ordering of **\-mer types** (random, alternating, block, graft)
*   Forms of **tacticity** (isotactic, syndiotactic, atactic, eutactic)
*   Backbone **chain configurations** (conformality, linear vs. branched chains)
*   **Crosslinking** with disulfide covalent bridges, to create an **elastomer** with "rubbery" qualities

The class ends with a quick recounting of the discovery and impact of **rubber vulcanization**, in which difficult-to-manage raw rubber gum becomes a more useful material by heating and adding sulfide to create crosslinking.
