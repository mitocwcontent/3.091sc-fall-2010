### Lecture Summary

This session focuses on polymer synthesis, the relationships between polymer structure and properties, and the culture implications of polymers.

The two forms of **polymer synthesis** (**addition** and **condensation**) are described in terms of processes, resulting chemical structures and properties, and example materials. Factors affecting **recyclability** are described, along with defining **thermoplastic** and **thermoset** characteristics. **Crystallization zones** are presented as a means for controlling a polymer's mechanical performance.

Prof. Sadoway summarizes the **properties of polymers** as follows:

*   Electrically insulating
*   Transparent to visible light (amorphous material) vs. opaque
*   Chemically inert
*   Strong covalent bonds (thus good for packaging)
*   Low density
*   Solid at room temperature

Polymers have had significant **impact on society**. The economic and performance improvements introduced by polymer-based substitute materials have transformed many aspects of modern daily life, and led to entirely new products. The class discussion ranges from early 20th century inventions (e.g. **nylon**, **Bakelite**), to the late 1960s fascination with **plastics**, to present-day concerns about **recycling** and **human health** impacts.
