### Lecture Summary

Biochemistry is an integrative topic that connects many prior topics, and governed by the same laws that apply to inanimate matter. Biology – especially at the molecular level - is solid state chemistry. "Mother Nature is a **polymer** engineer gone wild!"

This lecture starts with **amino acids** as the building blocks of **proteins**, and in particular looks at their structure.

*   All amino acids have an sp3 hybridized carbon at their center (aka "**alpha carbon**").
*   Three of the four bonds are identical in all amino acids (**amine** group, lone hydrogen, **carboxyl** group). The fourth bond is the side chain — "R" or the **substituent**, i.e. "nature's choice."
*   Twenty amino acids comprise all proteins.
*   Nineteen of these twenty amino acids in proteins are **chiral**.

Prof. Sadoway surveys some amino acid properties, focusing on behavior in water. In an aqueous solution, the amino acid transfers a proton, becoming a **_zwitterion_**. Applying the **Le Châtelier principle** to scenarios of increased and decreased pH, Prof. Sadoway walks through the amino acid chemical responses, concluding: "This is what animates the stuff of life!"

**Chirality** can have profound implications for the biological response to particular chemicals. The drug thalidomide contained an **enantiomer** that had unforseen interactions with a human enzyme, leading to a wave of birth defects.

The lecture ends with discussion of the kinetics of organic compounds, specifically the extreme case of **explosives**. Prof. Sadoway describes the tremendous damage caused by the 1917 Halifax explosion, in which a ship loaded with TNT and other explosive chemicals caught fire in the harbor, causing the largest explosion of the pre-nuclear age.
