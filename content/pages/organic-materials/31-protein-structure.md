### Prerequisites

Before starting this session, you should be familiar with:

*   the prior sessions in this Organic Materials module ([Session 27]({{< baseurl >}}/pages/organic-materials/27-introduction-to-organic-chemistry) through [Session 30]({{< baseurl >}}/pages/organic-materials/30-amino-acids))
*   [Session 18: X-Ray Diffraction Techniques]({{< baseurl >}}/pages/crystalline-materials/18-x-ray-diffraction-techniques)

### Looking Ahead

This session is the second of three sessions on biochemistry, and completes the foundation for the next session's culminating exploration of the structure of DNA.

### Learning Objectives

After completing this session, you should be able to:

*   Sketch the **structures of various amino acids as a function of pH**.
*   Explain the behavior of the **zwitterion**.
*   Define and show the significance of the **isoelectric point** (pI).
*   Understand the basis of **primary, secondary, and tertiary structures** of proteins.
*   Explain the role of **hydrophobic** and **hydrophilic** effects in protein structures.

### Lecture Summary

The lecture begins with further discussion about **zwitterion** behavior (introduced in [Session 30]({{< baseurl >}}/pages/organic-materials/30-amino-acids)), with the **titration curve** used to depict the relationship between degree of **protonation** and **pH**. An interesting application of zwitterion behavior is **gel electrophoresis**, in which an electrified gel column of varying pH allows a mix of different amino acids to be separated and analyzed.

Most of the lecture is devoted to **protein structure**. The **peptide bond** is the means of creating long macromolecule chains out of individual amino acids. These chains become a basis of life, as they encode information in different **sequences** of amino acids. (As an aside, amino acids can be remembered by their 3-letter "airport code" analogs.)

*   **Primary structure** is the backbone amino acid sequence order.
*   **Secondary structure** relates to packing, and comes in three forms: 1) the **alpha helix**, as the chain coils back on itself to **maximize hydrogen bonding** between "galleries" around the spiral; and 2) the **beta pleated sheet,** in which hydrogen bonds are maximized between macromolecules; and 3) **random structure**.
*   **Tertiary structure** affects the macromolecule's **conformation**: a range of interactions between nearby R-groups cause the backbone chain to fold. Mechanisms include covalent (disulfide) and hydrogen bonds, electrostatic attraction, and hydrophobic and hydrophilic interactions.
