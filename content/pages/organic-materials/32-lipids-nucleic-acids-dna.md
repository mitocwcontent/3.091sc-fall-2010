### Prerequisites

Before starting this session, you should be familiar with:

*   Prior sessions in this Organic Materials module (starting with [Session 27]({{< baseurl >}}/pages/organic-materials/27-introduction-to-organic-chemistry)), and particularly the fundamentals of protein structure as described in [Session 31]({{< baseurl >}}/pages/organic-materials/31-protein-structure): 
    *   Composition (primary structure of amino acid chains)
    *   Packing (secondary structures of alpha helix, beta pleated sheet, and random coil),
    *   Conformation (tertiary structure or folding caused by R-group interactions)
*   X-ray crystallography, as introduced in [Session 18: X-Ray Diffraction Techniques]({{< baseurl >}}/pages/crystalline-materials/18-x-ray-diffraction-techniques)

### Learning Objectives

After completing this session, you should be able to:

*   Describe several methods of **denaturing proteins** and provide practical examples of each method.
*   List the characteristics and properties of **lipids**.
*   List the characteristics and properties of **nucleic acids**.
*   Draw the **chemical structure of DNA**, and indicate the role of **hydrogen bonding** in forming the structure.
*   Describe how the chemical structure of DNA carries **information** and supports **replication**.

### Lecture Summary

After a quick review of the previous session, Prof. Sadoway begins with a discussion of **denaturing proteins** – disrupting protein **secondary and tertiary structures**. Examples of the denaturing process include:

*   Changing temperature (frying an egg)
*   Changing pH (pickling food)
*   Introducing oxidizing/reducing agents to rearrange disulfide bonds (hair styling)
*   Introducing detergents, which destabilize hydrophobic pockets

Next, the lecture introduces **lipids**.

*   Lipids are defined by their properties, not by their chemical composition; they are soluble in solvents of low polarity.
*   Examples include fats, oils, cholesterols, and hormones. Some lipids have a hydrophilic head and hydrophobic tail; arranged in two layers, tail to tail, they produce a **lipid bilayer** capable of self-assembly.
*   The lipid bilayer is the basis of **cell walls**. It includes integral proteins that change conformation in response to certain conditions, creating dynamic physical responses in the cell wall – once again, chemistry as the animating force of life.

After lipids, the lecture proceeds with the structure of **nucleic acids**.

*   Nucleic acids carry information that directs metabolic activity, including **replication**.
*   They are macromolecules whose structural unit is the **nucleotide**, consisting of three building blocks: a sugar (ribose or 2-deoxyribose), a phosphate acting as a bridge and a 'spacer,' and an **amine group** (one from the set AGCU for RNA, and AGCT for DNA).
*   The amine groups combine in pairs (A-T or C-G), and intermolecular spacing and hydrogen bonds lead to the **double helix structure**.
*   The order of A-T and C-G pairs ("letters") in chains creates "word" sequences of the **genetic code**.

This lecture ends with a history of the **discovery of DNA's double helix structure**: early insights by Oswald, Chargaff's rule, Franklin's **x-ray crystallography** experiment and its subsequent controversial use by Watson and Crick.
