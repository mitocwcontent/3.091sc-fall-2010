### Lecture Summary

**First-order** chemical reactions (e.g. decomposition of cisplatin, N2O5; radioisotope decay) have **concentration-independent** rates, which is sometimes expressed as the **half-life**. **Second-order** rates (e.g. decomposition of NO2) are **inversely proportional to concentration**. To determine the order and rate constant of an unknown system, **integral** and **differential** methods can be used to **linearize** experimental data measuring concentration over time. **Catalysts** affect reaction rates by adsorbing, aligning, or otherwise physically manipulating reactants, changing the **activation energy** of a reaction. Reaction rates are also limited by **mass transport** of reactants and products. In solids, atoms move via **diffusion**, driven by **concentration gradients**, as described by **Fick's first law**; the proportionality constant in this case is D, the **diffusivity**.
